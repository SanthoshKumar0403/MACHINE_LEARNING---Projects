🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project
📌 Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and travel-related features. This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

🎯 Business Problem

Given passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare, can we predict survival probability accurately?

This type of predictive modeling is widely applicable in:

Risk analysis

Customer segmentation

Decision support systems

🗂 Dataset Information

Source: Kaggle – Titanic Dataset

Records: 891 passengers

Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Key Features:

Pclass – Ticket class

Sex – Gender

Age – Passenger age

SibSp – Siblings / Spouses aboard

Parch – Parents / Children aboard

Fare – Ticket fare

Embarked – Port of embarkation

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed survival distribution across gender, class, and age groups

Identified missing values and outliers

Visualized feature relationships affecting survival probability

Observed higher survival rates among female passengers and higher-class tickets

🛠 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values (Age, Embarked)

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding

Scaled numerical features where required

Selected relevant features to improve model performance
