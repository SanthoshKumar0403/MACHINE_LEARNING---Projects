🔥 Natural Gas Price Prediction & Storage Valuation

Strategic Time-Series Analysis for Energy Market Decision-Making

Author: Santosh Kumar
Role Target: Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Quantitative Analyst

📌 Project Overview

This project delivers a data-driven framework to analyze, forecast, and economically evaluate natural gas prices using historical market data.
The objective is to support long-term storage and contract pricing decisions by modeling seasonality, trends, and volatility in natural gas markets.

The solution mirrors how energy trading desks and strategy teams evaluate price curves for storage optimization and risk-aware planning.

🎯 Business Objective

Energy firms rely on accurate forward price expectations to decide:

When to buy natural gas

Whether to store it

When to sell to maximize margins

This project answers:

“Given historical price behavior, what is the expected price of natural gas at any future date, and how can this be used to value storage decisions?”

📊 Data Description

Source: Market price snapshot data

Frequency: Monthly (End-of-Month prices)

Period Covered: October 2020 – September 2024

Market Type: Physical natural gas delivery prices

The dataset captures real-world energy market behavior, including volatility from global supply-demand disruptions.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Key Insights

✔ Strong Seasonality:

Winter months show recurring price spikes driven by heating demand

Summer prices remain relatively softer

✔ Volatility Events:

Sharp fluctuations during global energy disruptions

Prices exhibit mean reversion over the long run

✔ Strategic Insight:

Storage acts as a volatility-smoothing and profit-enhancing mechanism

🧠 Modeling Approach
📈 Forecasting Technique: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing

Why Holt-Winters?

Explicitly models level, trend, and seasonality

Robust for short- to medium-term energy price forecasting

Widely used in industry and financial time-series analysis

Model Intuition (Simplified):

Level: Baseline price

Trend: Directional movement over time

Seasonality: Monthly recurring patterns

Forecast = Level + Trend + Seasonality

📉 Forecast Output

Generated a 12-month forward price curve

Enables:

Indicative long-term pricing

Strategic planning for storage contracts

Designed for decision support, not high-frequency trading

🏦 Storage Valuation Framework

The project extends beyond forecasting into economic value creation:

💡 Storage Logic

Buy gas during low-price (summer) periods

Store the gas

Sell during high-price (winter) periods

💰 Valuation Formula
Storage Value = (Expected Future Sell Price − Purchase Price) × Volume − Storage Costs


This mirrors real-world energy trading and infrastructure valuation models.

📌 Illustrative Use Case

Purchase natural gas during forecasted seasonal lows

Withdraw and sell during forecasted winter peaks

Use the forward curve to estimate expected margins and justify storage decisions

⚠️ Limitations & Risk Considerations

Does not explicitly model:

Geopolitical shocks

LNG supply disruptions

Macroeconomic regime changes

Assumes historical seasonality patterns persist
